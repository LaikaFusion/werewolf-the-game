                    <h1>Rules</h1>
    
                        <p>Rules adapted from <a href="https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/">https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/</a>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Setting Up</h2>
                        <p>Assemble a group of players. An odd number is best, although not absolutely mandatory. There should be at least seven players.</p>

                        <p>At the start of the game, each person will be assigned a role, either a Villager, a Seer (optional), a Doctor (optional), or a Werewolf.</p>

                        <h2>Gameplay</h2>

                        <p>The game proceeds in alternating night and day rounds. Begin with nighttime.</p>

                        <div class="theNight">
                            <h4>The Night</h4>
                            <p><img src="img/moon.png" width="200px"></p>
    
                            <p>At night, the moderator tells all the players, "Close your eyes."</p>
    
                            <p>The moderator says, "Werewolves, open your eyes." The werewolves do so, and can identify each other in the Werewolves chat. The moderator should also note who the werewolves are.</p>

                            <p>The moderator says "Werewolves, pick someone to kill." The werewolves silently agree on one villager in their private chat. The other players are sitting there in the dark, and the werewolves don't want to give themselves away.</p>

                            <p>When the werewolves have agreed on a victim, and the moderator understands who they picked, the moderator says, "Werewolves, close your eyes."</p>

                            <p>Now, the moderator awakens the Doctor and says, "Doctor, who would you like to heal?" The Doctor selects someone they'd like to heal. The person chosen (which could be himself) will survive if the werewolves chose to kill the them. If someone was killed, and then saved by the Doctor, the moderator will let the village know by saying, "Someone has been saved", at the beginning of day time.</p>

                            <p>The moderator says "Seer, open your eyes. Seer, pick someone to ask about." The seer opens their eyes and silently selects another player. (Again, it is critical that this be entirely silent -- because the seer doesn't want to reveal his identity to the werewolves.)</p>

                            <p>The moderator responds "yes" if the seer pointed at a werewolf, and "no" if the seer pointed at an innocent villager. The moderator then says, "Seer, close your eyes."</p>

                            <p>The moderator says, "Everybody open your eyes; it's daytime." and lets the villagers know who has been killed. That person is immediately dead and out of the game. They do not reveal their role.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="theDay">
                            <h4>The Day</h4>
                            <p><img src="img/sun.png" width="200px"></p>

                            <p>For the first day, go around and have everyone introduce themselves in chat (Example: Hey, I'm Matt. I'm the baker here in town, and I'm a villager.</p>

                            <p>Daytime is very simple; all the living players gather in the village and decide who to kill. As soon as a majority of players vote for a particular player to kill, the moderator says "Ok, you're dead."</p>

                            <p>There are no restrictions on speech. Any living player can say anything they want -- truth, misdirection, nonsense, or a barefaced lie. Dead players may not speak at all. Similarly, as soon as a majority vote indicates that a player has been chosen to be killed, they are dead. If they want to protest their innocence or reveal some information (like the seer's visions), they must do it before the vote goes through.</p>

                            <p>Once a player is killed, night falls and the cycle repeats. </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>Winning</h2>

                        <p>The villagers win if they kill both werewolves.</p>

                        <p>The werewolves win if they kill enough villagers so that the numbers are even. (Example: Two werewolves and two villagers) </p>
